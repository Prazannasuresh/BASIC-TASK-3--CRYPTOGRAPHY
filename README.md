The program requires an input from the user to enter the file directory, along with the file name.
The program basically reads the content in the text file, and encrypts it, thus generating a signature.
The other part of the program decrypts the same ciphertext and the generated digital signature is verified with the first generated signature. Similarly, ciphertext and plaintext are verified.
